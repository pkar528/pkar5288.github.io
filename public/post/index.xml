      <description>Different coding languages do not have to exist apart from each other. When we moved on from Rstudio to Jupyter Notebook in class, I thought that I was moving on completely from R to Python. With this, I thought I would have to change my entire frame of mind about how to do any computations using data. However, with Reticulate, I can jump between R and Python and essentially have the two languages talk to one another!</description>
